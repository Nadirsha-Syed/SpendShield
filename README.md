# SpendShield 🛡️
### Predictive Financial Guardrails for MSME Business Owners

**SpendShield** is a real-time behavioral AI engine designed to protect small business owners from liquidity crises. By analyzing spending velocity and transaction patterns, it provides automated **"Safe Daily Limits"** to ensure month-end financial stability.

## 🚀 The AI/ML Pipeline
Our system moves beyond simple budgeting by using a multi-staged hybrid inference engine:

1. **Linear Regression (Velocity Engine):**
   - **Purpose:** Month-end liquidity forecasting.
   - **Logic:** Implements the $y = mx$ theorem where $m$ represents the daily spending velocity. It projects the total monthly liability based on real-time "burn rates."
   

2. **Decision Tree Classifier (Categorization):**
   - **Purpose:** Context-aware expense classification.
   - **Logic:** A CART-based (Classification and Regression Tree) structure. It utilizes a hierarchical decision path (Root -> Decision Nodes -> Leaves) to distinguish between 'Business Assets', 'Utilities', and 'Lifestyle Expenses' based on amount thresholds and merchant metadata.
   

3. **Temporal Sequence Analysis (LSTM-Inspired):**
   - **Purpose:** Behavioral Anomaly Detection.
   - **Logic:** Monitors the last $N$ transactions to detect "Temporal Spikes." It flags deviations that exceed 350% of the rolling historical mean, mimicking the pattern recognition of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to identify non-linear spending shocks.
